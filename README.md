# My static Hugo website

This repository contains the files for [my blog](https://richardwaal.nl/). It's built with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Azure

The blog is currently hosted on Microsoft Azure using a storage account and Azure CDN. Deployment of the website is still done manually, but will be automated using [Azure Pipeles](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/). A blog describing the details about the hosting and deployment will be published soon.
